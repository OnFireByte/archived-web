# Snip-Websocket-Addon

A very small program that build with Go. Its purpose is to serve now-playing track's data via web-sockets, work with (and require) [Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip) as its dependency (Like the name suggests).

This project also includes a simple webpage that can be used as an overlay in live streaming.\

PS. This is also the first time that I use Go\
